It's all because of the song space oddity and Walter Mitty jumping on
to the helicopter.<!--more-->

I love this scene. It is so easy and so hard at the same time to take
a leap of faith and jump right on to a figurative helicopter. 


All the emotions: the fear of letting go on the things you have
(steady job, my air-plants, designer mugs, and Andrew's cat etc.), the
excitement of taking off and embracing the unknown, and the courage to
not settle, and live the life you dreamed of. 

So hey, I think I would enjoy spending some time seeing the world and
doing absolutely nothing!

### Here's me jumping on to a helicopter like Walter Mitty.
