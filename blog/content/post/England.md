England is GREEN and full of sheep and castles! <!--more-->

We rode 200+ miles from Heathrow to Bristol with some beautiful detours: Oxford, Cotswold, and Bath.

Highlights:

Wallingford Castle - gorgeous old castle that had 0 tourist. I liked it a lot. We played around with the camera and made friends with some very smart crows.

First time cooking with our cook gears - we stopped at a gas station to get some gas for cooking. What happened next was probably the most dangerous moment of our trip. Andrew was trying to fill our bottle with gas, but he underestimated the pressure of the pump. So the gas shoot right out and splashed all over us. I screamed and ran away. We both felt like we died a little that day. Luckily it was pouring rain, so we were able to wash a bit off riding home.

Oxford - enjoyed the park and watching the young souls paddling along river Thames. We also did some pub crawling and looked for the drunk one (gargoyles). Why didn't I go to oxford for collegeâ€¦

Cotswolds ANOB (area of outstanding natural beauty) - I think it's a must for England. Small hills full of cow parsley (white flowers) and sheep. The villages were all fairy tale like. We camped a few nights. It was awesome! We would walk to a bar called the halfway house from our camp. It was a bit far but they had the best sticky toffee pudding in the world! During our little night walk, we thought we were going to get attacked by the sheep. They were all in the middle of the road sleeping, and we had to walk straight into them. Turns out sheep are pussies, so we were okay. Some of the hills were tough, but that's what makes the beer taste better.

Broadway Tower - it's north in Cotwolds. Cutest tower I ever seen. I loved it and it goes well with ice cream.

Bath - we did a one day trip from Bristol to Bath. The whole way was a bike path and only 17 miles. Pleasant ride in the shades and then get to see some 5000 + years bath built by Rome.

Bristol - of all the places we visited in England, Bristol is the most not England like to me. It's a rebel city (okay it was just dirty). I liked the graffiti and the dangerous vive?
