Once you made up your mind on traveling, the logistics seems easy. <!--more-->

![Our luggage to start](/img/IMG_0057.jpg)

First you need to decide on weather you're going to sell all your stuff or store all your stuff. We decided to rent a storage room in Seattle. We have some personal belongings that we believe are non-replaceable (at that time). We gave ourselves one good week to move our boxes to the storage room. It sounded pretty doable when we thought we could borrow the truck from the storage unit. Turns out you need car insurance and we just canceled it for the trip. 

But there's always a way, luckily we were smart enough to rent a unit within walking distance - we carried everything from our apartment to the storage room with a two-wheel-dolly. It took us multiple trips till the very morning of our flight. And we were stilling running around and tiding things when the pick up van came. We didn't clear out our apartmentâ€¦To sum it up, it felt like we own some gangsters money and had to run away and pack our valuables in one night. 

A picture of us after pulling an all-nighter packing - dead but happy.

We were relieved once we were at the airport, since nothing more can be done for the apartment we moved out of.We flew from Seattle to Heathrow airport in England. The plane ride was like every plane ride, except no food was served on Iceland air... But I was super happy that our luggage (cardboard box) made it to Heathrow airport. It was soaked and barely holding our stuff together.

We took our luggage and bikes to the hotel by the airport shuttle bus; ate some Indian curry (chicken masala) for dinner; saw a rainbow; assembled our bikes in our room; made a mess in our room;slept for a bit then woohoo we were so ready!
