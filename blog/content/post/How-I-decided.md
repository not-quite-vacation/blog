It's all because of the song space oddity and Walter Mitty jumping on to the
helicopter.<!--more-->

I love this scene. It is so easy and so hard the same time to take a leap of faith and jump right on to a helicopter. 


All the emotions: the fear of letting go on the things you have (steady job, my airplants, designer mugs, and Andrew's cat etc.), the excitement of taking off and embracing the unknown, and the courage to not settle but to live a life you dreamed of. 

So hey I think I would enjoy spending some
time seeing the world and doing absolutely nothing!


### Here's me jumping on to a helicopter like Walter Mitty.
