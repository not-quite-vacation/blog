It's all because of the song space oddity and Walter Mitty jumping on to the
helicopter.<!--more-->

I was so touched by this scene. It seems so easy and so hard the same time when
one just takes a leap of faith and jumps right on to the helicopter. All the
emotions: The fear of letting go on the things that you are used to, the moment
of taking off and embracing the unknown, and the courage to not settle and
choose what really makes you happy. 

So hey I think I would enjoy spending some
time on just seeing the world and doing absolutely nothing.
