We arrived in Middle-Earth less than a week ago. Here are our impressions
from the start of our trek to Mount Doom. <!--more-->

Well we were actually headed to Mt. Cook.  But that's just
details. When we arrived we did the normal thing, and immediately begin
panicing. Apparently you should plan things ahead of time when you are
travelling in foreign countries.

We originally planned to ride a train on the last part of our journey,
but when we started to check train times we noticed a weird warning. There
was an earthquake two years ago that damaged the rail and highway along
the coast. So __plan B__ is to ride 650+ extra kilometers. We'll probably
try to get some busses along the way.

Next thing we noticed is March is not summer in NZ. It's pretty
chilly. The rain (and snow in higher altitudes) made things even
colder. When we crossed a high mountain the temperatures suddenly dropped
(apparently this is not a myth). The descent was bone-chilling. We were
totally soaked and now also experiencing freezing temps and wind from
the speed. When we spotted the first signs of civilization we stopped
and spent the night.

Which brings us to the second realization. NZ is expensive. At least from
what we've experienced thus far on the South Island prices for hotel/motel
are as expensive as NYC or a luxury resort. That night we were willing to
pay full price, but we saved a lot by camping the rest of the nights. Food
prices are about the same as America. Not too bad but not great for a
tight budget. The prices you pay are made up by the beautiful landscapes.

New Zealand is incredibly beautiful. I am so amazed. It's hard to bike
more than 10 minutes without wanting to take another photo. In areas
that seem like they'd be major tourist hubs it is still easy to be the
only people there. When we biked to Mt. Cook and Lake Pukaki there were
times where you could see around 20km away and not see another person
or car or caravan.

The funny thing about caravans, they seem to be 75% of the traffic on the
roads we've been riding. I thought New Zealand was big on "wild camping"
or what they call here "freedom camping" but it seems to be banned in
many areas. This creates a "camping" parking lot. Freedom camping is a
weird name for something that is pretty strictly enforced. It was funny
for us to pass a full freedom parking lot after spending the night alone
on the shore just 10km away.
